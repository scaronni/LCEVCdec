// This tests api/include/LCEVC/lcevc_dec.h against event-based operation. This is similar to
// `test_event_manager`, but with a focus on how the code might realistically get used. For
// example, the event_manager tests wouldn't catch deadlocks caused by accessing the API from
// within a callback. These tests also test asynchronous operation.
