 * The GPU command buffer format is as follows:
 *
 * A block of 64 bit commands and bitmasks (64 bitmask for DDS, 256 bitmask for DD)
 *  (NB: 2 64 bit words for DDS, 5 64 bit words for DD)
 * A block of TU values one per set bit in 'Set' or 'Add' bitmasks
 *
 * THe 64 bit commands are:
 *
 *     2 bits: operation
 *    18 bits: blockIndex
 *    27 bits: dataOffset
 *     8 bits: bitStart
 *     9 bits: bitCount
 *
 * The offset fields allow for up to 15360Ã—8640 image size with a residual on every pixel.
